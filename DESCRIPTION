Description: RaMWAS provides a full set of tools for 
    methylome-wide association studies for enrichment technologies.
    The steps of the pipeline include scanning aligned reads from BAM files,
    calculation of multiple quality control measures,
    creation of coverage matrix,
    principal component analysis for capturing batch effects and 
    accounting for cell composition differences, 
    association analysis with respect to phenotypes of interest correcting for PCs and known covariates,
    and multi-marker analysis using elastic net.
